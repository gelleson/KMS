# KMS

It's a simple project to keep my knowledge. It's split into few modules divided by knowledge type. This project already or will include a few features to manage knowledge as:

-  Save and edit knowledge in markdown files. 
-  Versioning of the knowledge.

The second purpose of this project is the language training system. I need some free tool which can assist with my learning process. I hope this project will help other people.

 I merge two goals into one project. Maybe in the future, I will split the project into an independent one.
